I certainly had enough intelligence, nor did I have any difficulty understanding the geometrical and astronomical topics included in the normal curriculum, aided as I was by figures, numbers, and proportions. These were, however, required courses, nothing that would bespeak an exceptional inclination towards astronomy. And since I was supported at the expense of the Duke of Württemberg, and saw my comrades, whom the Prince, upon request, kept trying to send to foreign countries, stalling in various ways out of love for their country, I, being hardier, quite maturely agreed with myself that whithersoever I was destined I would promptly go.</td>\n",

I certainly had enough intelligence, nor did I have any difficulty understanding the geometrical and astronomical topics included in the normal curriculum, aided as I was by figures, numbers, and proportions. These were, however, required courses, nothing that would bespeak an exceptional inclination towards astronomy. And since I was supported at the expense of the Duke of Württemberg, and saw my comrades, whom the Prince, upon request, kept trying to send to foreign countries, stalling in various ways out of love for their country, I, being hardier, quite maturely agreed with myself that whithersoever I was destined I would promptly go.   \n",
